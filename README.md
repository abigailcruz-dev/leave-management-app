##  2 Database Setup (MySQL via XAMPP)

>  *You must have XAMPP installed. Start both Apache and MySQL.*

1. Open **XAMPP Control Panel** and click **Start** for **Apache** and **MySQL**.
2. Open **phpMyAdmin** (click “Admin” next to MySQL).
3. Create a new database named:

```
leave_management
```

4. Import the database:
   - You should have received the `leave-management.sql` file via email/Google Drive.
   - Go to the newly created database > Click **Import** tab > Choose the `.sql` file > Click **Go**.

##  3 Backend Setup (Django)

1. Open a terminal in the project root directory.
2. Navigate to the backend folder:

```bash
cd backend
```

3. Create a virtual environment (if not yet created):

```bash
python -m venv env
```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
env\Scripts\activate   # Windows
```

5. Install the Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6. Configure your MySQL database connection in `leave_app/settings.py`:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'leave_management',
        'USER': 'your_mysql_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_mysql_password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '3306',
    }
}
```

7. Run the development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

> Django will now run on: [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

---

##  4 Frontend Setup (React.js)

1. Open a new terminal window or split terminal in VS Code.
2. Navigate to the frontend folder:

```bash
cd frontend
```

3. Install frontend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Run both backend and frontend concurrently:

```bash
npm run dev
```

> The frontend should now run on: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

---

##  You’re Done!

You now have the full Leave Management App running locally with:

- Backend at: [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)
- Frontend at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

##  Sample User Accounts

Use the following demo accounts to explore the app:

### 👤 Employee Account
- **Username:** `employee`
- **Password:** `employee123`

### 👨‍💼 Manager Account
- **Username:** `abithedev`
- **Password:** `12341234`

---

## ➕ Creating New Users

Once logged in as a **manager**, you can:

- Add new **employees** or **managers** directly from the **Manager Dashboard**.

However:

>  If you add a new **manager**, they will be treated as a normal user until you update their permissions in the Django Admin Panel:
>
> [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin)
>
> Go to **Users**, click on the newly added manager, and check the following:
> - ✅ `is_staff`
> - ✅ `is_superuser` *(optional if you want full admin access)*
> - ✅ Add to group `manager` 

This ensures the new manager can access manager-only features correctly.

---

##  Admin Access

You may create a Django superuser to access the admin panel:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Login here: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin)

##  Notes

- Make sure your MySQL service is always running when you use the app.
